1. **Main Branch:** Serves as the stable codebase, often named "main," "master," or "production."
2. **Feature Branches:** Created from the main branch for developing new features or enhancements.
3. **Development Branch:** Aggregates feature branches for testing before merging into main.
4. **Release Branch:** Prepares the codebase for deployment, ensuring stability before merging to main.
5. **Hotfix Branches:** Quickly address critical issues in the main branch, merging fixes back into main and development.
